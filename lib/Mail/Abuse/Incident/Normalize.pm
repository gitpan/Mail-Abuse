=head1 NAME

Mail::Abuse::Incident::Normalize - Filter the text of a report within an Email

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Mail::Abuse::Report;
  use Mail::Abuse::Incident::Normalize;
  my $i = new Mail::Abuse::Incident::Normalize;
  my $report = new Mail::Abuse::Report (incidents => [$i] );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class handles various important tasks related with recognizing an
abuse report. The specific tassks are:

=over

=item *

Parse the headers and the body of the email message

=item *

Provide a translation from HTML to text if no suitable part is
included in the original report

=item *

When a report has been forwarded or quoted multiple times, this class
removes the indications at the beginning and left-hand side (E<gt>).

=back

The parser based on this class must be the first in the list of
parsers passed to the report object, so that all parser that need its
services can access them automatically.

The following new keys are created into the corresponding report after
running this class. These are:

=over

=item B<header>

A C<Mail::Header> object with the header of the message.

=item B<body>

Contains a reference to the body of the message, as a single scalar or
string.

=item B<normalized>

Set to the scalar C<Mail::Abuse::Incident::Normalize> to indicate that
this class did the normalization.

=item B<tz>

The guessed timezone from the message. This might come from matching
it in the body of the message, from the Date header or from other
sources. This should be used as a "last-resort hint" by other Incident
parsers.

=back

The following method is implemented bu this class:

=over

=item C<parse($report)>

Pushes incidents into the given report, based on parsing of the text
in the report itself.

It must return a list of objects of the same class, with the incident data
(IP address, timestamp and other information) filled.
