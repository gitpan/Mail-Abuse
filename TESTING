It is a good idea to edit this file as -*- indented-text -*- when
using Emacs.

This file includes directions for special testing of modules that
require additional (manual) steps to complete.

Testing GoogleGroups
====================

To test the Google(tm) Groups reader
(Mail::Abuse::Reader::GoogleGroups) when a proxy is required to reach
the groups server, you should issue the following commands in your
BASH-compatible shell

		export GOOGLE_PROXY=YOUR-PROXY-NAME:port

and rerun the tests.

Note that the GoogleGroups reader is currently broken since the
interface was changed. Patches will be incorporated to the
distribution after light testing, but no active development by the
author is going on in this module.

This may be deprecated in future releases.

Testing POP3
============

In order to test the POP3 reader (Mail::Abuse::Reader::POP3), you must
create a config file in your working directory named
"poptest.cfg". This file must contain the following directives

     pop3 server
     pop3 username
     pop3 password
     pop3 delete

with suitable values for your installation. See the file
etc/sample.conf for information on the format of these entries.

It is also very good if the mailbox contains at least two messages so
that fetching can be tested properly (if you're really paranoid).

For the rest of the modules, autonomous tests are included. These
tests automatically provide any configuration options they might need,
so the whole process is automatic.
