In order to test the POP3 reader (Mail::Abuse::Reader::POP3), you must
create a config file in your working directory named
"poptest.cfg". This file must contain the following directives

     pop3 server
     pop3 username
     pop3 password
     pop3 delete

with suitable values for your installation. See the file
etc/sample.conf for information on the format of these entries.

It is also very good if the mailbox contains at least two messages so
that fetching can be tested properly (if you're really paranoid).

For the rest of the modules, autonomous tests are included. These
tests automatically provide any configuration options they might need,
so the whole process is automatic.
