Your version of Perl is not supported by Params::Validate. This
warning is being produce because sometimes the code will work anyway,
though ocassional core dumps and similar problems are not unheard
of. I thought you might want to know.

Please consider upgrading your Perl to 5.6.1 or better, which seems to
be the recomendation that comes with Params::Validate. See its README
file for more information.

This distribution includes plugins for the Template::Toolkit that
require Template::Plugin, which is not available on this system. The
plugins cannot be tested without prerequisites, but will be installed
anyway. If you later want to use them, simply install
Template::Toolkit.

    print <<EOF;

Looks like this host does not have Test::Pod installed. Without this module,
the Pod documentation cannot be tested. This is not a big deal really, but
you might want to install Test::Mod by issuing the following command:

    perl -MCPAN -e "install('Test::Pod')"

at a nearby shell. This is nice because it allows easy tests of your own
documentation.

eval { require IO::Scalar;
       $checker = 1; };

unless ($checker)
{
    print <<EOF;

Looks like this host does not have IO::Scalar installed. This module
is used in some tests, but is not required for the production
code. This is not a big deal really, but you might want to install
Test::Mod by issuing the following command:

    perl -MCPAN -e "install('IO::Scalar')"

at a nearby shell. This is nice because it allows easy tests of your own
documentation.

       $checker = 1; };

unless ($checker)
{
    print <<EOF;

Looks like this host does not have a number of modules that are
required by utilities in the bin/ directory of this
distribution. Generally, it would be a good idea to install the
modules by following the recipe given below:

    perl -MCPAN -e shell
    cpan> install URI::URL
    cpan> install LWP::RobotUA
    cpan> install Mail::Mailer
    cpan> install HTML::Entities
    cpan> install HTML::LinkExtor
    cpan> quit

at a nearby shell. The supplied scripts are intended to be useful to
many audiences. If you have reasons not to install those modules, take
a look at the scripts and see if they apply to your environment.
